# Brown Note

Sample "sticky notes" app using PyQT5, with SQLAlchemy for data persistence.
Mirror of https://www.learnpyqt.com/tutorials/build-desktop-notes-application.
May add some additional functionality or swap out the storage.

The "sticky note" abstraction is great for quick note jotting. Want to capture it as a means of input to a local MD store.
